# Parkinson-disease-detection-using-ML
# The hc contains all the raw audio files of the parkinson detected persons and pd contains the healthy one 
# first run the deta_set_creation.py to create a dataset of the raw files which are in "hc" and "pd"
# after this run the traing script which is "training_model.py" and it will give a trained model named "parkinson_ensemble_model.pkl" and a "scaler.pkl".
# then run the streamlit ui by running the WEB_app.py.
